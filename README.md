# Analysing live stocks 📈

Analysing live stock indexes using [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) libraries in Python.

This is a Hack The Burgh VI submission for the Optiver Challenge. 

The project was led and **coded by me**.

## How I built it 👨‍💻
* Python (JupyterLab)
    * pandas
    * Matplotlib

### Accomplishments that I am proud of 😁
1. Being able to play around data only 6 months after learning to code.
2. Meeting people with a similar mindset in the hackathon!
3. Making a calm and steady presentation in front of the judges (even though the project was not completed!).

## What I learned 📚
- [X] Reading `.csv` files.
- [X] Displaying certain parts of DataFrames.
- [X] Modifying the data (such as dropping NaNs).
- [X] Plotting and combining graphs.
- [X] Grouping by.
- [X] Visualising correlation.
- [X] Data is beautiful and fun to work with!

## What is next? 🔜
- [ ] Plotting live graphs.
- [ ] Implementing an algorithm which analyse the data.
- [ ] Starting on Machine Learning.
